# Budget-Navigator

What do cars, OOP and graphs have in common? They are the  building blocks of this project. :)

This C++ application represents a journey planner. Until now I put together some of the building blocks (the graph data structure, the locations) and also wrote a method for finding the minimum cost path from a location to the other using Dijkstra's algorithm (got a little bit ahead of myself tho :D ).

I plan on adding the "car" entity and when all the base things are done, a GUI will be considered.
